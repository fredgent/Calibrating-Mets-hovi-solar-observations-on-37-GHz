    %Determine the solar disk position and size from each map as well as

    %Level (QSL) for unity.
    %This can be done using a binary combination of two disk methods (1 and 
    %2) and three normalisation methods (a, b, and c).
    %The methods are: (1) intentionally weighted center of mass of the radio
    %sample coordinates, (2) fitting a circle for those sample coordinates
    %which we, by geometry, expect to belong to the solar limb, (a) sort the
    %intensity samples and detect the point of zero curvature from the index vs.     intensity dependency, the S-curve, (b) iteratively calculate the
    %statistical mean and standard deviation of the intensity of 
    %those points which are located within the solar disk and not too close
    %to the limb, (c) detect two significant peaks from the intensity histogram,
    %the lower intensity peak being the background and the higher the QSL.

    %The method (2) can be augmented using two additional sets of information.
    %When we observe exactly at the limb, we would expect $0.5$ QSL intensity
    %due the the beam mixing disk and background signal.
    %If one particular sample has intensity $0.4$ QSL, we would expect the
    %sample to be slightly more away from the center.
    %Collecting a large set of observations on different conditions, we can
    %estimate how quickly the intensity drops as the beam passes the limb 
    %from disk to background.
    %Utilizing this limb profile, we can fine tune the position of each limb
    %sample in the target set of (2) and proceed iteratively to obtain more
    %accurate circle fitting.

    Any exceptional bright or dim features near the limb will affect the
    apparent shape of the solar disk in the map. 
    They will affect the outcome of the disk center position when we run the
    circle fitting algorithm.
    Bright features favour center fitting towards the feature,
    while dim features repel the center.
    We should thus exclude a specimen from the target set of the circle fitting
    by proximity of any pre-determined bright or dim radio feature, since these
    features affect the apparent shape of the disk.
   
    Each radio specimen is given heliographic coordinates as well as time of
    observation.
    We collect a two-dimensional histogram where each rectangular slot has a
    time range as well as a range of heliographic latitude.
    Integrating all the radio data, we aim to obtain a diagram analoguous to
    the famous butterfly diagram of sunspot activity.
    Assuming the diagram will have similar wing patterns as the sunspot
    butterfly, we will apply a feature detection for wing elements.
    We apply the same algorithm for the sunspot butterfly and compare the shape
    and duration of each wing.

\section{Introduction}

  %MJK References required. FAG: added, sufficient?
  The solar magnetic field is known to switch polarity in a full cycle of 
  approximately % ca. FAG abbr. -->  full word convention
  22 years, which consists of two sunspot cycles \citep{HEN19,Babcock61}.
  At %In FAG In --> At
  the beginning of each sunspot cycle, the solar magnetic field is an axial
  dipole.
  %FAG reworded
  %Due to differential rotation, this field, being dominantly axisymmetric and running mainly in meridional planes, hence being dominantly 
  %poloidal, is transformed into an azimuthal field with the azimuthal direction being opposite between opposite hemispheres.
  %Solar differential rotation transforms the predominantly axisymmetric
  %Poloidal magnetic field into an azimuthal field with a 
  %MJK typo tendancy; but is it only a tendency? 
  %FAG: I interpreted tendency as approximate; reworded to avoid ambiguity

  %for opposite
  %polarity between hemispheres.
  Solar differential rotation transforms the predominantly axisymmetric
  poloidal magnetic field into an azimuthal field with opposite
  polarity between hemispheres.
  %MJK This is the controversial part of the solar dynamo process, and we need to think how to phrase things here.
  In the presence of convection and the Coriolis force due to solar rotation,

  action of turbulent vortical flows stretching, twisting and looping the field,
  known as the 
  $\alpha$-effect \citep{SKR66,KR80}.
  %After ca. $11$ years, this has resulted in dipolar field of opposite polarity, 
  %FAG ca. --> appr, and tense
  %After approximately 11 years this evolves into a dipolar field with
  %MJK whereto 'this' refer is unclear.
  %FAG: clarified
  After approximately 11 years the large scale magnetic field
  evolves into a dipolar field with
  polarity reversed from its original sign
  and the next sunspot cycle begins.
  %FAG remove paragraph break and reword
  The full 22 year cycle comprises two such sunspot cycles.
  
  %The full magnetic cycle is ca. $22$ years and consists of two sunspot cycles.

  %FAG insert paragraph break
  %Each sunspot cycle begins with 
  %an axial dipole, after which various activity on the visible surface of the Sun will first increase, 
  %then reach maximum and again decrease to a minimum, while it migrates from high latitudes towards the equator. This is 
  %FAG reword the Sun --> Sun NASA capitalization convention
  %Each sunspot cycle emerges from the quiet Sun of an axial dipole as
  %MJK 'emerges from the quiet Sun of an axial dipole' sounds a bit odd.FAG: rephrased 
  Starting from a quiet Sun containing a relatively weak axial dipole,
  each sunspot cycle emerges as
  activity on the visible surface of the Sun, typically near mid-latitudes
  %FAG Moved from below
  ($\pm20^{\circ}$ to $\pm 30^{\circ}$).
  While the frequency and coverage of the sunspots increases towards a maximum,
  the location of the activity drifts equatorward. 
  This migration continues after the maximum with decreasing activity
  closer to the equator, bringing the sunspot cycle to an end.
  This was first recorded in the Maunder butterfly diagram by Edward Maunder
  in 1904.
  %FAG: moved from below
  Since sunspots are a feature of Sun's magnetic field, and as the solar
  magnetic field is mostly axisymmetric, 
  %MJK References needed here FAG: OK?
  the longitudinal location of the
  activity can reasonably be neglected \citep{PBKT06}.
  Considering this two-dimensional time-latitude histogram of sunspot activity
  or magnetic field intensity, similar butterfly 
  diagrams are also recovered from solar magnetograms

  %%MJK I think the toroidal field is evolving all the time; maybe better is to say during the dominance of the toroidal field?
  %
  %During the time of evolving azimuthal field, we observe various types of activity, such as sunspots, magnetic regions as well as radio brightenings. These features appear first in the middle latitudes ($\pm 
  %20^{\circ}$ to $\pm 30^{\circ}$) on both hemispheres.

  Mets\"ahovi radio observatory (MRO)\footnote{
  \href{https://www.aalto.fi/en/metsahovi-radio-observatory}{

  is observing emissions, primarily in
  $\SI{37}{GHz}$ frequency band, dating back over forty years.

  is a good proxy for the intensity of the magnetic field.
  These are also well suited to observing the thermal emissions from the quiet
  Sun.
  Comparing and contrasting the maps from these emissions with other
  observations can help to reveal more about the structure of the magnetic
  field in plasma of varying temperature and by inference height.
  Furthermore, the data incorporates almost four magnetic cycles, yielding
  a valuable resource to investigate long-term variation within and between 
  cycles, alongside and in contrast to other sources.

  %%MJK What kind of solar activity does 37GHz trace? This is an important point to clarify.
  %FAG added new para break

  \fag{add paragraph reviewing previous Mets\"ahovi publications and references}
  %MJK One should explain in more detail what Kallunki has already published from this data.

  %FAG I have summarised the rest of the introduction to keep it concise and
  % have copied the rest to the methods section, where it is better suited.
  Across the lifetime of the MRO the equipment has experienced several upgrades
  and evolution of the data format.
  This article shall describe the pipeline of data processing to transform the
  raw data into a time series of solar radio maps, normalised, corrected for
  instrumental bias, atmospheric noise and effects, time of day and seasonal
  effects and solar limb dimming effects.
  We present two methods for correctly detecting the position of the solar disk
  in each map and three methods for normaliseing the signal levels, such that
  the background \emph{black sky} has value zero and the 
  %FAG: expanded definitiion in response to MJK later query
  %Quiet Sun Level (QSL) value unity.
  Quiet Sun Level (hereafter QSL),
  the solar intensity in the absence of surface magnetic activity, has
  value unity.
  The maps are then projected from RA and Dec onto their rotating heliographic
  surface coordinates.
  We also introduce tools we have prepared for automatic tracking of active 
  regions, which are suitable for any magnetograms or similar maps, and which
  we shall apply in detail in future publication.
  This is described in Sect.~\ref{sect:methods}.

  %MJK 'From this' does not sound understandable. 
  %From this we present a time-latitude histogram of the radio intensity,
  %FAG: reduced
  We present a time-latitude histogram of the radio intensity,
  including previously inaccessible machine-drawn maps from 1978 -- 1987 and
  up to 2020.
  This yields the most complete time series thus far available from MRO, 
  spanning almost completely the last four sunspot cycles.
  We compare our butterfly diagram with one constructed from the sunspot 
  counts during the same epoch.
  These are presented in Sect.~\ref{sect:results} together with some 
  examples of our active region tracking.
  Finally, we discuss in Sect.~\ref{sect:discussion} 
  %%MJK some 
  %how the radio 
  %observations differ from other solar observations, 
  %%MJK Consistency with Shibasaki could be left to be said later.
  %consistent with the 
  %results of \citet{Shibasaki13}. 
  %FAG: response to MJK 
  how MRO observations differ from some other solar observations, 
  %MJK Consistency with Shibasaki could be left to be said later.
  and also compare with the results of \citet{Shibasaki13}. 

  %FAG the residual text has been copied to Methods 
  %During the 40 years, the equipment 
  %has experienced several upgrades and there has also been changes in the data format.
  %he data requires careful 
  %normalisation procedures, after which the butterfly diagram can be constructed from the solar maps. The solar maps from 
  %1978 to 1987 were originally recorded on magnetic tapes, out of which the data was rendered on contour maps using a 
  %mechanical plotter. Since then, the magnetic tapes have been lost, and the maps were only available as 
  %%MJK it would not hurt to stress that they were printer on paper only -> plots -> printouts.
  %these plots.
  %%MJK or rather pattern recognition?
  %Using various image recognition techniques featured in \cite{masterthesis}, these contour maps were converted back into 
  %numerical form. For these prepared contour maps, 
  %%MJK Define better what you mean by 'solar disk being available'. It might not be clear to a common reader.
  %the solar disk was already available, while for the later maps from 
  %1989 to present the disk 
  %has to be detected using automatic image recognition. 
  %%MJK To make it more clear:
  %%MJK The purpose of this paper is to present two methods () for detecting the disk and ....
  %We present two methods (1: S-curve and 
  %center of mass, 2: convex hull) for detecting the disk and three methods (a: S-curve and constant fraction, b: 
  %statistics and outlier neglection, c: interpolating between histogram peaks) for normaliseing the signal levels so that 
  %zero is the black sky at the background and unity is the Quiet Sun Level (QSL).
  %%MJK Then there should be a sentence stating that "As our final data product we present here a butterfly diagram of radio brightenings extending over the full time span of the recorded Mets\"ahovi solar data set".
  %
  %%MJK This would be better in the methods section, to outline the general workflow from the raw data to the final product.
  %When the disk fitting is done, every radio sample can be projected into rotating heliographic surface. We use the 
  %Carrington coordinates for this. As every sample now has time, heliographic latitude, and intensity relative to QSL, we 
  %can average them on a two-dimensional grid in order to obtain a butterfly diagram. The sunspot data is already in a 
  %format that has latitude and time bins, so simple interpolation is needed to convert it into the same domain as our 
  %butterfly. For radio data, the measurable quantity is the intensity, while for the sunspot data it is the fraction of 
  %area covered by sunspot, between two arcs of constant latitude.

  %%MJK "We also perform a preliminary analysis of the obtained butterfly diagram, by performing feature detection algorithm ... that is discussed in section BLAA. Our preliminary findings are presented in Sect. BLAA2."
  %perform feature detection in order to get quantified information on the wing 
  %shapes. 
  %%MJK Again, introduction might not be the best place to describe the workflow, but the methods section.
  %This is done iteratively, starting with the each hemisphere and predefined solar cycle start and end times 
  %(later: wing). For each wing, we give the high intensity cells a considerable weight and fit a polynomial of a desired 
  %degree to the time-latitude domain. This gives the wing shape and root. Statistical variance with respect to the root 
  %gives us the wing thickness, which can be assumed a constant or a polynomial function of desired degree. We fit the 
  %third polynomial in the time,intensity domain, where the intensity is averaged over the wing latitudes for each time 
  %cell. The relevant roots or local minima of this intensity polynomial give the begin and end times for each wing. Having 
  %now quantified the shape and dimensions of each wing, we can neglect any outlier cells from the grid and perform several 
  %iteration steps to refine the shape. In the last stage, all the wings will coexist in the same grid, which now contains 
  %all the 40 years of data from both hemispheres. We will set the weights to zero for those cells which would have 
  %overlapping wings, in order to encourage the algorithm to produce non-overlapping wings. We tried several sets of 
  %parameters, while the most promising fits were produced with first order wing shape and thickness and fourth order 
  %intensity profile.
  %
  %%MJK So, to summarize my comments to the intro: expand significantly on Kallunki earlier paper(s), and pinpoint in detail what was there, and what is new in here, and why this work was necessary. Expand on the relevance of the dataset: what does 37GHz data describe, why is it relevant, what else has been done before in the frequency band? Move the parts describing the workflow to Sect. 2.

\subsection{The solar maps}\label{sect:source}


  During a typical measurement, the antenna beam makes a sweep across the visible solar disk (Fig.~\ref{typicalmap}). 
  There are three major sets of conventions during the history the record. The earliest of these maps feature the solar 
  cycle 21 and have not been available until appropriate digital processing tools were implemented in \cite{masterthesis}.
  \begin{enumerate}[A]
    \item
    After June 2015 the sweeps have been horizontal, with shifting altitude
    between sweeps, as shown in Fig.~\ref{typicalmap}{\bf(b)}.
    These modern maps respect the true path of the antenna, typically recorded
    with $25$ samples per second for two minutes.
    %MJK The final map in solar coordinates is presented in Fig.1(c)...
    %The final map in solar coordinates is presented in Fig\ref{typicalmap}{\bf(c)}.
    %SKK: Currently we have no carrington maps planned to be shown on the paper
    \item
    Until May 2015 the maps were scanned in the equatorial direction,
    so that declination is shifted between adjacent sweeps, as displayed in
    Fig.~\ref{typicalmap}{\bf(a)}.
    The maps assume linear antenna tracks with constant speed and sample rate.
    \item
    The solar maps from 1978 to 1987 were originally recorded on magnetic
    tapes, from which the data was rendered onto paper contour maps using a

Each line in a digital solar map file contains the time and coordinates of a sample as well as the recorded intensity 
value. The coordinates are relative to the expected location of the center of the Sun on the sky. The intensity is 
measured on $\SI{37}{GHz}$ and contains linear and logarithmic output from the amplifier as digital values. In this 
paper, we focus on the linear scale. However, the logarithmic scale is more sensitive for very low 
intensities and also avoids saturation during flare events, thus offering prospects for future 
research.

We use the word \emph{calibration} for describing the combined effort of normalising and centering a map. The applicable 
methods are described in Sect.~\ref{sect:disk}. The raw intensities of a scan have an arbitrary scale, as in Fig.~\ref{typicalmap}{\bf(a-c)}. We 
need to normalise the signal levels and also correct for any minor offsets in the sample coordinates in order to have a 
properly centered map. The purpose of normalisation is to have zero intensity at the background and unit intensity for 
the QSL. For the contour maps up to year 1987, we trust the graphical markings and no calibration is needed.

Previous works, such as \cite{metsahovi40}, \skk{(We need to discuss this with Metsähovi people and survey for more 
references)} have studied MRO solar maps at the level of individual radio samples and collected statistics of those 
above a fixed threshold intensity. These have not included the historical contour plots of the category C. Also analysis 
based on manually collected values has been made, such as \cite{kallunki_diss} and \cite{valtaoja}. For the first time, 
the whole 40 years of data is available in a form that can be accessed in a fully automated means, allowing detailed and 
analysis in accurate heliographic coordinates. This includes, among other applications, calculating temporal averages of 
radio samples within a given region on the rotating heliographic surface. Heliographic features can be distinguished 
based on their actual separateness. 

Cycle 21 maps have previously been analysed with manual methods in \cite{kallunki_diss} using undigitised maps. The calibration process has been developed further.

  \subsection{Solar map centering and normalisation} \label{sect:disk}

In order to extract heliographic information from the solar scans, we need the accurate position of the visible solar disk superimposed on the set of antenna samples. This is done by analysing the intensity distribution. The intensity is high at the solar disk, and it drops drastically as we go to the background area. There are two factors that affect the shape of this transition:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shape and width of the beam produced by the $\SI{14}{m}$ disk at MRO. At the limb regions, the solar disk is convoluted with the black sky, thus resulting in lower intensity.
\item Optical depth of the chromosphere. At the limb region, we probe higher altitudes and would expect higher temperature readings. We call this the limb brightening.
\item Latitude dependency of the chromosphere temperature, as measured on $\SI{37}{GHz}$.
\end{enumerate}

We assume that the antenna beam is spherically symmetric. The actual accuracy of this approximation is subject to 
further study in the future. Also, the item 3. in the above list is not as significant as the others. Latitude 
dependency is also a function of the solar cycle phase. So far, we ignore the effects of latitude dependency in order to 
produce biasless butterfly diagrams. We have, however, implemented tools for taking the latitude dependency into account 
in order to measure certain chromosphere parameters.

As a result of the above considerations, we can except a relatively radially symmetric intensity profile at the limb 
region. We use a straightforward approach to first identify the limb region, which is c.a. $0.9 .. 1.1$ radii from the 
disk center. This already produces a fairly good centering, but we seek to further improve it. The limb sample 
brightness gives a hint of how far from the center it should be, supposed the general limb intensity profile is known. 
Utilising this information, we can perform a circle fitting and more sophisticated centering. This process is described 
in detail in Sect.~\ref{sect:detailed_calib}.

  Solar maps are generated by sweeping the beam of the radio telescope at the proximity of the solar disk while recording signal intensity.
  Each solar map $S$ consists of $N_S$ samples $s_i$:
  \eqnl{radio_sample}{
    S &=& \left\{ s_i \;:\; i = 1, 2, ..., N_S \right\}\,\text{ and}\nonumber\\
    s_i &=& \left( t_i, x_i, y_i, u_i, ... \right),
  }
which specifies location $(x_i,y_i)$ and intensity $u_i$ as recorded at time
$t_i$ of each $s_i$ observation.
During calibration, as described below, additional derived quantities ($...$)
are attributed to each $s_i$.
Location is specified in equatorial coordinates relative to the expected
position, $(\RA_{\astrosun}, \Dec_{\astrosun})$, of the central point of Sun
at time $t_i$.
With right ascension cosine corrected, such that maps have unit aspect ratio, we apply 
\eqnl{relative_radec}{
  x_i = \frac{\RA(s_i)
      - \RA_{\astrosun}(t_i)}{\cos \left( \Dec_{\astrosun}(t_i) \right)}, &&
  y_i = \Dec(s_i) - \Dec_{\astrosun}(t_i)\text{.}
  }
  %FAG: rephrase
  %The absolute pointing of the antenna is not sufficiently accurate, while we can expect the relative accuracy to be 
  %better. We thus need to determine the center of the visual disk for each map. Also, since the signal levels $u_i$ are on arbitrary scale, we 
  %need to normalise them. A solar map consists of three regimes:
  We do not rely on the targeting accuracy of the antenna, and instead
  determine the center of the visual disk from each map $S$, from which we
  define the relative location of each $s_i$.
  Also, since the signal levels $u_i$ have arbitrary scale, 
  they need to be normalised.
  A map $S$ samples from each of the regions we designate as
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Background: The beam probes outer layers of the corona. Low intensity.
  \item Limb: Transition from corona to chromosphere.
  \item Disk: The beam probes chromosphere with varying incident angle. High intensity compared to background. Features, such as dim and bright regions, are visible.
  \end{itemize}

  For a map $S$, we will perform a preliminary statistical analysis (see Sect.~\ref{sect:s_curve}) in order to extract 
  two representative intensity values, $\s{u}{background}$ and $\s{u}{disk}$.

The samples are originally in arbitrary units, so we study the intensity value statistics in order to fix reference 
values background and disk intensities. The samples is one map are sorter by absolute intensity, as described by Juha 
Aatrokoski at MRO. We observe two plateau regions in the intensity vs. sample index plot in 
Fig.~\ref{S-curve_example}{\bf(a)}. Between these regions the curvature of the plot changes sign, where we place the 
pivot point of the normalisation (Fig.~\ref{S-curve_example}){\bf(b)}. Out of the samples with higher intensity compared 
to the pivot, we take the median as a representative of the inner disk. Similar choice is done for the samples of lower 
intensity. We take the lowest intensity tertile as a representative for the background, now having fixed the signal 
range from background to QSL as the starting point of further iterations steps.

  We will then perform a linear 
  transformation for the raw intensity values $u_i$ and obtain the first normalized intensities $v_i^{(0)}$ as
  \eqnl{map_normalisation}{
  v_i^{(0)} := \frac{u_i - \s{u}{background})}{\s{u}{disk} - \s{u}{background}} \; \text{with} \; s_i \in S \text{.}
  }
  The normalized intensities are then used for initial centering of the map in Sect.~\ref{sect:initial_centering}. 
  This allows us to refine the equatorial coordinates of the samples as:
  \eqnl{map_centering}{
  \left( x_i^{(0)}, y_i^{(0)} \right) := \left( x_i, y_i \right) - \left( x^{(0)}, y^{(0)} \right) \text{.}
  }
  If the radius of the solar disk is not fixed, we can optionally also measure it. This finishes the initial calibration 
  round, for which we use a superscript $\cdot^{(c)}$ with $c=0$, also in Equations~\ref{map_normalisation} 
  and~\ref{map_centering}. This will be followed by additional calibration rounds, starting from 
  Sect.~\ref{sect:further_optimization}. Each calibration round produces a new normalized intensity value 
  $v^{(c+1)}$(Sect.~\ref{sect:disk_outliers}) for each sample. Using these new values $v^{(c+1)}$, the center for the 
  disk is further optimized as $(x^{(c+1)}, y^{(c+1)})$ in Sect.~\ref{sect:disk_outliers}.

The choice of $A$ is not critical, since the antenna beam radius is large ($2.4^\prime$) compared to the accuracy of any 
reasonable model.

When the disk fitting is done, every radio sample can be projected into rotating heliographic surface. We use the 
Carrington coordinates for this. As every sample now has time, heliographic latitude, and intensity relative to QSL, we 
can average them on a two-dimensional grid in order to obtain a butterfly diagram. The sunspot data is already in a 
format that has latitude and time bins, so simple interpolation is needed to convert it into the same domain as our 
butterfly. For radio data, the measurable quantity is the intensity, while for the sunspot data it is the fraction of 
area covered by sunspot, between two arcs of constant latitude.

perform feature detection in order to get quantified information on the wing 
shapes. 
%MJK Again, introduction might not be the best place to describe the workflow, but the methods section.
This is done iteratively, starting with the each hemisphere and predefined solar cycle start and end times 
(later: wing). For each wing, we give the high intensity cells a considerable weight and fit a polynomial of a desired 
degree to the time-latitude domain. This gives the wing shape and root. Statistical variance with respect to the root 
gives us the wing thickness, which can be assumed a constant or a polynomial function of desired degree. We fit the 
third polynomial in the time,intensity domain, where the intensity is averaged over the wing latitudes for each time 
cell. The relevant roots or local minima of this intensity polynomial give the begin and end times for each wing. Having 
now quantified the shape and dimensions of each wing, we can neglect any outlier cells from the grid and perform several 
iteration steps to refine the shape. In the last stage, all the wings will coexist in the same grid, which now contains 
all the 40 years of data from both hemispheres. We will set the weights to zero for those cells which would have 
overlapping wings, in order to encourage the algorithm to produce non-overlapping wings. We tried several sets of 
parameters, while the most promising fits were produced with first order wing shape and thickness and fourth order 
intensity profile.

\section{Discussion}\label{sect:discussion}

We have featured a software package for processing solar maps. The radio observations reproduce the butterfly diagram 
observed on sunspot data, and are able to see the extended cycle at high latitudes. We automatically detect bright and 
dim features from the maps and track them from map to map. This allows us to analyze their migration on heliographic 
surface. We also obtain various structural information from these regions.

  
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The big picture}

The radio samples in solar maps can be divided into three categories: \begin{itemize} \item Quiet Sun background \item 
Bright features \item Dim features. \end{itemize} Bright and dim features are a signal of activity. Our intention is to 
study the development and lifetime of this activity, for which we have developed algorithms for extracting these 
features from the maps. We also need to understand how the quiet Sun behaves, and for this purpose, any activity is 
excluded. The brightness of these quiet areas supposedly depend on heliographic latitude and the solar cycle. When these 
regions are observed, the ap:qparent brightness also depends on the distance from the visual center, due to atmospheric 
and antenna beam convolution effects. We want to measure these effects in order to properly compensate for them. We do 
not want any activity to affect these measurements, so we will benefit if we already know where the active and dim 
regions are. The compensation model consists of an implicit butterfly as well as a radial model for the brightness, and 
the expected brightness of a quiet region is taken as a product of these two.

Accurately understanding the radial effects in observations benefits the centering algorithm. Also, we benefit from 
prior knowledge of active regions since they can be excluded in the statistics which we feed into the centering 
algorithm. Otherwise the features at the limb would bias the center of the map.

Radial model also increases the dynamic radius of the map, and we are able to detect bright and dim features at the 
limb, although with increased noise. Each part of the model will benefit other parts and result in a data model of progressive accuracy, as outlined in Fig.~\ref{roadmap}.

Ultimately, all these three aspects, quiet, bright, and dim features, have a known physical origin, and their 
statistical appearance and characteristics can be reproduced in appropriate simulations.

\skk{At least I need this list in order to keep track of reserved letters. I tried using 'longtable' to automatically 
wrap the table along many pages, but it complains about two column mode. I also tried 'supertabular' but it didn't work 
either. Maybe it is best to manually split the table as I did in my mastersthesis. It is anyway good to assign the
